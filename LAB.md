- The **apiRouter.js** Handles full CRUD functionality, and is tested in Postman
- The **viewsRouter.js** handles all responses to your URL extensions
- While the server is running, Postman can manage your data, and your website is refreshed to see the changes made
- The data is properly plugged in with the views to be rendered
- There is at least 1 instance of Conditional Rendering
- There is at least 1 instance of Repeated Rendering (using `.forEach()`)
