//need a home page that will populate for each users content
//maybe have a login page and add that to their user object
//each user has their own object with data
//maybe something like this
//{name: 'John', numberofposts:


//couple of ideas

//make one similar to yahoo fantasy player commments
//really simple
//just need maybe a login not neccessary
//just one homepage that carries all the 'posts' like a timeline for everybody
//something at the bottom or top to begin typing your message
//a function to like somebodies post
//when you click on the person you can seee their activity maybe
//can see how many likes they received and how many comments(posts) they made
//maybe add following feature later
//following just shows you all of their 'activity' in another 'timeline'
//need to add the loading thing while stuff is updating

//create comment form on same page as timeline after login? hitting post does the post command and brings you to the next url or however it worked before
